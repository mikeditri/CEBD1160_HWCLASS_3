#the main difference from what I could gather online is that bother docker and singularity are 
#container. Docker allows you to contain all apects of the OS and all features so no matter where 
#you open the program it will always work, no matter what. Singularity allowd you to buid a 
#container however it also allows you to leverage the services and features of the host machine, 
#which can be a big advantage when combining with scietific (complex) tools in combination with 
#the container
